# Hangman-Game
Game Rule is :

 1.Press any key to get started!

2. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

The words that I use for the game are fruit names(apple, mango, banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange)

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

3. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

4. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

5. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
